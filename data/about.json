      "My approach to problems is deeply rooted in my CliftonStrengths - Harmony, Context, and Analytical thinking. I believe in understanding the \"why\" behind everything, whether it's Federal Reserve policy decisions, supplement effectiveness, or why my Dutch pronunciation still makes locals chuckle.",
      "Currently, I'm preparing for an Associate Product Manager transition, which has led me to explore business frameworks, case study methodologies, and product thinking. This learning lab is where I document those discoveries, test hypotheses, and share what actually works.",
      "When I'm not diving into financial models or experimenting with new productivity methods, you'll find me attempting to have conversations in Dutch with varying degrees of success, or analyzing whether that new supplement actually improved my energy levels (spoiler: data is everything)."
